# MERCIA
Tool for the manual mesh extraction of intracranial aneurysms (MERCIA) by using MeVisLab.
Please cite our paper (see bottom)

### Usage
* Install MeViaLab from [www.mevislab.de/download](https://www.mevislab.de/de/download)
* Copy MERCIA files into folder, double click on START_MERCIAv4_LOCAL.mlab to open the MeVisLab network:

* Now double click on the orange module to start MERCIA

#### Load Data
* The first screen allows for loading the data, you can either load a single image (i.e. a single *.dcm file) or a stack of images (i.e. a folder with the single slices)
* You can also account for t-z-dimension switches, in case the directory input produces a dataset with z-dimension = 1 and e.g. 512 time points
* Once you are satisfied, click on "Exctract Initial Mesh"

#### Extract Initial Mesh
* Please carefully adapt the windowing parameters by clicking and holding the right mouse button
  * up and down -> change center of windowing
  * left and right -> change width of windowing
  * ctrl + moving of pressed mouse wheel -> zoom in and out
  * shift + moving pressed mouse wheel -> pan / translate
  * include small vessels but avoid surrounding tissue (see example): ![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53fad388-8808-4fa2-a07f-1e72d82ae8a2)
 
  * once you are satisfied, set parameter for width to 0.05 or smaller in order to produce a binary segmentation: ![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1227bc25-0acf-4e04-bb4a-e37483e54b91)
  * select "build initial mesh" (mesh extraction take a few seconds)
 
#### Check Result
* sometimes the view is not centered, fix it by pressing "View All" (1): ![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31c01ec0-70f7-46bd-9a53-a8cfe64ba45b)
* You can remove smaller, unconnected parts of the mesh, a "+" and a "-" indicates whether the parts are contained or not: ![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1be3678-c398-4663-843a-d3c66ad887f6)
* You can save the mesh as *.obj file now

#### Cut Mesh
* You can also edit your mesh by using some of MeVisLab's functionalities again -> Press "Cut Mesh" Button
* Navigation is the same: ctrl + moving pressed mouse wheel -> zoom in and out; shift + moving pressed mouse wheel -> pan/translate; ESC -> change between object and select mode
* If you don't see your model press the "View All" button ![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57942b5d-29df-4693-b3d7-ae6210a6b0cb)
